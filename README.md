# HelloWorld
My first repository
I am making a change here , and just a little about myself.  I am teaching myself Drupal 8 so that I can venture into web development.  I want to become a developer mainly for the career change, and to get away from the manual labor of the help desk field.  I look forward to being able to set at a desk, listen to some classical piano and just CODE !
